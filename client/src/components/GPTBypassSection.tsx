const INFERENTIAL_KNOWLEDGE_SAMPLE = `Inferential knowledge and logical dependence Two kinds of knowledge: direct and indirect
Some knowledge is direct; some is indirect.
Indirect knowledge is knowledge that is acquired through inference.
To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one.
Inferences, when legitimate, are made in accordance with legitimate rules of inference. Rules of inference, when legitimate, correspond to dependence-relations.

Two kinds of dependence-relations: causal and logical

There are two kinds of dependence-relations: logical and causal.
  Logical dependence-relations hold among propositions. A proposition is a truth or a falsehood.
  Example of a logical dependence-relation: The proposition that x is a triangle cannot be true unless the proposition that x has three sides is true. Therefore, x s being a triangle depends on x s having three sides.
  Causal relations hold among states of affairs, not truths and falsehoods. (A state of affairs is anything that is in space-time.)
Example of a causal dependence-relation: Smith cannot pass the class unless Smith studies.
Therefore, Smith s passing depends on his studying.
The first-dependence relation is interpropositional, i.e. it holds between propositions.
  The second is objectual, i.e. it holds between occupants of the space-time manifold and therefore between  objects,  relative to some delineation of that term.

Propositions the objects of belief
   The objects of knowledge are propositions. It isn't known unless it's believed and it isn't believed unless it's a proposition.
   One can be aware of non-propositions, e.g. rocks, trees, people, but one does not in the relevant sense know them. Rather, one knows truths about them.

Relations of logical dependence not known through observation
   Some dependence-relations are known, not through sensory observation, but through conceptual analysis. Such truths are analytic, as opposed to empirical. Examples of analytic truths are:

1. If P, then either P or Q.

2. There are infinitely many primes.

3. Nothing can be numerate or literate without being sentient.

4. There are no laws where there is no government.

5. There is no recursive definition of the class of Dedekind-cuts.

6. 1+1=2.

7. 1+1?3.


  1 obviously expresses a dependence-relation, and 2-7 non-obviously do so, as their meanings are:


  2*. A set s having finitely many members depends on its not having the set of prime numbers as a subset.

3*. An entity s being literate or numerate depends on its being sentient. 4*. The presence of law depends on the presence of government.
  5*. A set s having either finitely many or denumerably many members depends on its not having a cardinality equal to or greater than the cardinality of the class of Dedekind cuts.

6*. A set s being a couple depends on its being the union of two non-overlapping unit sets. 7*. A set s being a triple depends on its not being the union of two non-overlapping unit sets.

Analytic truth and analytic knowledge

Analytic knowledge is always knowledge of dependence-relations.
Empirical knowledge can be either direct or indirect; the same is true of analytic knowledge.

Knowledge vs. awareness
   Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. I do not need to have these concepts---or, arguably, any concepts---to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. My knowledge of that truth is a conceptualization of my awareness of that state of affairs.
  Equivalently, there are two kinds of awareness: propositional and objectual. My visual perception of the dog in front of me is a case of objectual awareness, as is my awareness of the tightness of my shoes. My knowledge that there is a dog in front of me is a case of proposition- awareness, as is my knowledge that my shoes are uncomfortably tight.`;

const DEFAULT_STYLE_SAMPLE = `There are two broad types of relationships: formal and functional. Formal relationships hold between descriptions. A description is any statement that can be true or false. Example of a formal relationship: The description that a shape is a square cannot be true unless the description that it has four equal sides is true. Therefore, a shape's being a square depends on its having four equal sides. Functional relationships hold between events or conditions. (An event is anything that happens in time.) Example of a functional relationship: A plant cannot grow without water. Therefore, a plant's growth depends on its receiving water. The first type is structural, i.e., it holds between statements about features. The second is operational, i.e., it holds between things in the world as they act or change. Descriptions as objects of consideration. The objects of evaluation are descriptions. Something is not evaluated unless it is described, and it is not described unless it can be stated. One can notice non-descriptions — sounds, objects, movements — but in the relevant sense one evaluates descriptions of them. Relationships not known through direct observation. Some relationships are known, not through direct observation, but through reasoning. Such relationships are structural, as opposed to observational. Examples of structural relationships are: If A, then A or B. All tools require some form of use. Nothing can be both moving and perfectly still. There are no rules without conditions. 1 obviously expresses a relationship; 2–4 do so less obviously, as their meanings are: 2*. A tool's being functional depends on its being usable. 3*. An object's being both moving and still depends on contradictory conditions, which cannot occur together. 4*. The existence of rules depends on the existence of conditions to which they apply. Structural truth and structural understanding. Structural understanding is always understanding of relationships. Observational understanding can be either direct or indirect; the same is true of structural understanding.`;

const HUME_INDUCTION_SAMPLE = `HUME, INDUCTION, AND THE LOGIC OF EXPLANATION 

We haven't yet refuted Hume's argument—we've only taken the first step towards doing so. Hume could defend his view against what we've said thus by far by saying the following: Suppose that, to explain why all phi's thus far known are psi's, you posit some underlying structure or law that disposes phi's to be psi's. Unless you think that nature is uniform, you have no right to expect that connection to continue to hold. But if, in order to deal with this, you suppose that nature is uniform, then you are arguing in a circle, since the uniformity of nature is itself an inductive principle. For an explanation to be good isn't for it to be correct. Sometimes the right explanations are bad ones. A story will make this clear. I'm on a bus. The bus driver is smiling. A mystery! 'What on Earth does he have to smile about?' I ask myself. His job is so boring, and his life must therefore be such a horror.' But then I remember that, just a minute ago, a disembarking passenger gave him fifty $100 bills as a tip. So I have my explanation: 'he just came into a lot of money.' But that explanation is terrible. Why? Because getting such a tip is so improbable that my explanation makes the datum more mysterious than it was before I had any explanation at all. Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. I do not need to have these concepts—or, arguably, any concepts—to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. My knowledge of that truth is a conceptualization of my awareness of that state of affairs. People who are the bottom of a hierarchy are far less likely to spurn that hierarchy than they are to use it against people who are trying to climb the ranks of that hierarchy. The person who never graduates from college may in some contexts claim that a college degree is worthless, but he is unlikely to act accordingly. When he comes across someone without a college degree who is trying to make something of himself, he is likely to pounce on that person, claiming he is an uncredentialed hack. The more useless a given employee is to the organization that employs her, the more unstintingly she will toe that organization's line. This is a corollary of the loser paradox. People don't give good reviews to writers who do not already have positive reviews. This is a veridical paradox, in the sense that it describes an actual vicious circle and does not represent a logical blunder. Communications technology is supposed to connect us but separates us into self-contained, non-interacting units. Solution: Communications technology is not supposed to connect us emotionally. On the contrary, it is supposed to connect us in such a way that we can transact without having to bond emotionally.`;

const EXPLANATORY_EFFICIENCY_SAMPLE = `Consider two alternative accounts of explanatory efficiency. The first says that an explanation is more efficient when it explains more with less. The second says that an explanation is more efficient when it explains the same amount with less. These accounts differ in what they take to be the relevant baseline for comparison. The first account compares explanations that use the same resources but explain different amounts. The second compares explanations that explain the same amount but use different resources. Both accounts are plausible, but they can conflict. An explanation might be more efficient by the first account but less efficient by the second. This suggests that explanatory efficiency is not a univocal concept. Rather, there are different dimensions along which explanations can be more or less efficient. Understanding these dimensions is important for evaluating competing explanations and for developing better explanatory practices.`;

const RATIONAL_BELIEF_SAMPLE = `Rational belief requires more than just having good evidence. It also requires that one's beliefs hang together in a coherent way. A person might have excellent evidence for each of their individual beliefs, but if those beliefs contradict each other, then the person is not fully rational. This points to a structural constraint on rational belief: one's beliefs must form a consistent set. But consistency is not enough. Rational belief also requires that one's beliefs be appropriately connected to each other. If I believe that it's raining and I believe that the streets get wet when it rains, then I should also believe that the streets are wet. This points to another structural constraint: one's beliefs must be closed under obvious logical consequences. These structural constraints on rational belief are as important as evidential constraints, but they are often overlooked in discussions of rationality.`;

const RAVEN_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `The raven paradox presents a puzzle about confirmation. Consider the hypothesis "All ravens are black." We can confirm this hypothesis by observing black ravens. But the hypothesis is logically equivalent to "All non-black things are non-ravens." And we can confirm this equivalent hypothesis by observing non-black non-ravens, such as white shoes or red apples. This suggests that observing a white shoe confirms that all ravens are black, which seems absurd. The paradox arises because we have conflicting intuitions about confirmation. On one hand, we think that logically equivalent hypotheses should be confirmed by the same evidence. On the other hand, we think that only ravens (or perhaps only black things) are relevant to confirming hypotheses about ravens. Resolving the paradox requires clarifying what we mean by confirmation and what counts as relevant evidence.`;

const HETEROLOGICAL_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `Heterological Paradox: A word is 'heterological' if it is false of itself. Thus 'monosyllabic' is heterological, whereas 'polysyllabic' is not heterological. Question: Is 'heterological' heterological? It is if it isn't and if isn't if it is. Solution: To say that 'polysyllabic' is true of itself is to say that 'polysyllabic' is polysyllabic. To say that 'is an English expression' is true of itself is to say that 'is an English expression' is an English expression. 'True of itself,' when meaningful, simply abbreviates some non-reflexive construction; and when it doesn't do so, the term 'self' an undefined pronoun—a free variable, in other words.`;

const LIAR_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `The Liar Paradox: Suppose Smith says "I am lying." He is lying if he's telling the truth and he's telling the truth if he's lying. Analysis: It is not words per se but the underlying meanings, or propositions, that are true or false. So when Smith says "I am lying", what he is saying, if stated perspicuously, is to the effect that: There exists a proposition P such that P is false if affirmed and true if denied and such that, moreover, I am not affirming P. But the statement just made is neither false-if-true nor true-if-false: it is simply false.`;

const BERRY_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `Berry's Paradox: The expression "the first number not nameable in under ten words" names that number in nine words. Solution: There are different ways of picking out a number. The canonical way of doing so is by using the usual numerical notation. Thus, the expression "117,334" is the canonical way of picking out the corresponding number, but "the exact number of dollars in Jim's saving's account" is not. In light of this, let n be the least number that cannot be canonically picked out in less than ten words. Given that E is not a canonical description of n, there is nothing paradoxical about the fact that E picks out n.`;

const WITTGENSTEIN_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `Wittgenstein's Rule-following Paradox: Any given course of conduct complies with many different rules, and there is therefore no good reason to say of a given act that it is an act of following this as opposed to that rule. So any putative case of following a given rule might equally reasonably be seen as a case of following some other, incompatible rule, and there is therefore no good reason to regard any act as a case of following any given rule. The solution: Taken in isolation, a given action can be interpreted as an act of compliance with any given one of a plurality of incompatible rules. If you say "4" when I ask you "what is 2+2?", I cannot on the basis alone rule out the possibility that you took "what is 2+2?" and "4" to mean, respectively, "I want to play chess" and "I do not have time for childish pastimes." But if that is what you meant, there will be independent evidence for it. So Wittgenstein's 'paradox' collapses into the trivial point that erroneous hypotheses may be compatible with artificially restricted data sets.`;

const SORITES_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `The Sorites Paradox: A single grain of sand is not a heap. If n grains of sand, then neither are n+1 grains. Therefore, a billion grains of sands are not a heap. Analysis: Three grains of sand is more of a heap than two; four are more of a heap than three. n+1 grains of sand are more 'heapy' than n grains. If, for arbitrary n, n grains of sand qualify as a heap, they do so because they are heapy enough relative to some benchmark. They may be heapy enough to alter the path of a rolling golf ball or they may be heapy enough to block traffic. In general, Sorites paradoxes are solved by replacing binary characterizations ('heap', 'rich', 'part of a given cloud') with the corresponding comparatives ('more of a heap', 'rich', 'more a part of that cloud'), along with the contextually supplied benchmarks.`;

const MILLET_PARADOX_SAMPLE = `The Paradox of the Grain of Millet: If a single grain of millet falls to the earth, it doesn't make a sound. But if a billion such grains do so, they do make a sound. Therefore, a billion nothings add up to something. Analysis: If a given grain of millet falls to the earth, it does make a sound. If you were millet-sized and appropriately located in relation to the millet grains impact with the earth, the sound would be intolerably loud. To say that a single millet-grain doesn't make a sound when it hits the earth is comparable to saying that your stereo doesn't make a sound because your deaf grandfather can't hear it.`;
