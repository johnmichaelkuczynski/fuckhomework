# Homework Assistant

## Overview

The Homework Assistant is a full-stack web application designed to provide AI-powered solutions for various homework types. It accepts text, image, PDF, and document inputs, leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed answers. Key capabilities include drag-and-drop file uploads, voice input, mathematical notation rendering, and PDF export. The project aims to offer a comprehensive, user-friendly tool for academic assistance, with ambitions to serve a wide market of students and educators.

## User Preferences

## System Architecture

The application employs a clear client-server architecture.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- **UI/Styling**: Shadcn/ui (Radix UI) and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Display**: MathJax for mathematical notation and integrated image display for graphs.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **File Processing**: Multer for uploads (PDFs, images, documents), Tesseract.js for OCR, pdf2json for PDF text extraction.
- **Graph Generation**: Chart.js with ChartJSNodeCanvas for server-side graph creation.

### Core Features & Design Patterns
- **File Processing Pipeline**: Standardized process from upload to text extraction, LLM processing, graph detection, and response generation.
- **Integrated Graph Generation**: Automatic detection and server-side creation of graphs (line, bar, scatter) based on LLM-generated data, seamlessly embedded into solutions. Supports multiple graphs per assignment.
- **LLM Integration**: Designed for multiple AI providers, allowing user selection and leveraging their capabilities for detailed solutions. Intelligent content detection ensures LaTeX notation is applied only to mathematical problems.
- **Voice Input**: Utilizes browser Web Speech API and Azure Speech Services for real-time transcription.
- **Mathematical Notation**: MathJax integration provides full LaTeX support, optimized for display and PDF export.
- **Dual Payment System**: Complete payment infrastructure with both PayPal and Stripe integration for user authentication, session tracking, and flexible payment options.
- **Multi-User Data Isolation**: A single shared PostgreSQL database enforces user-scoped data access via `user_id` filtering, preventing cross-user data access and ensuring secure deletion. Includes support for anonymous users.
- **GPT BYPASS**: Integrated functionality for text rewriting and AI detection score reduction, with a dedicated interface and seamless workflow between homework assistant and bypass features.

## External Dependencies

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **LLM APIs**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Perplexity
- **Payment Gateways**: PayPal and Stripe
- **CDN Services**: MathJax, Google Fonts
- **Speech Services**: Azure Cognitive Services (optional)
